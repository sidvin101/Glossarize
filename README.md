# Glossarize
A nltk project that searches for words in an article based off of complexity and from user threshold, displays the meanings of each one. 

## Problem Statement
Sometimes when reading an article or piece of literature, it can be overwhelming with the amount of words/complex information. Even with notetaking, these forms of literature could be seen as overwhelming and noninteractive. Glossarizer seeks to assist with this by providing helpful information about the wording, as well as make it a bit more interactive. 

## How it works:
Insert an article, and a threshold for the number of words you want glossarized. Using nltk, we can get the top n number of words that are the "most complex"

## Note
This was a solo project during the SacHacks competition and was attempted to be done under 24 hours.

## Current Taske
- Update the output with a better readable format for the JSON file
- Apply this value for a front end web application where the user can upload a file for glossarizing


# Notes:
- Glossarize.ipynb showcases the thought process behind the development of the python code, where the final function is showcased in the end.
